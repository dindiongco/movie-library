# movie-library

Flask Project where you can register and login and then add your own reviews and ratings based on movies you have watched. Each user will have a separate movie library saved in the database. Used an API to retrieve details on the movies such as the title and image of the movie. Created using Python Flask, CSS, Bootstrap 5 and HTML. 

Acknowledgements: https://www.themoviedb.org/ for the API.
